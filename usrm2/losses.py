    block. For a BINARY field a cell is present iff all its vertices are, i.e. it is the PRODUCT of
    them; for a soft field that same product is the probability the cell is present under independent
    voxels, so `V - E + F - C` over the products is the EXPECTED Euler characteristic -- and it is
    differentiable, which is the whole point.

    Returns [(sign, cell tensor, spanned axes), ...]; a cell tensor is indexed by its LOWEST corner and
    `spanned` says along which axes it has a second corner (which is what fixes its filtration height).

    For a direction `xi` and a height `h`, the entry is the expected Euler characteristic of the part of
    the complex whose vertices all satisfy `<v, xi> <= h` -- the classic ECT sweep. A cell enters at the
    height of its HIGHEST corner, and because `<v, xi>` is LINEAR that height is the lowest corner's plus
    `sum over the spanned axes of max(0, xi_axis)`: no search, one add. So the whole transform is, per
    direction, eight `index_add_`s with FIXED (geometry-only, gradient-free) bin indices and the
    differentiable cell products as values, followed by a cumulative sum over the height axis.

    This is the "fast chi" family of arXiv:2507.23763 (and the chi variant of villa's `ect_loss.py`): no
    persistence diagram, no matching, no C++ dependency. `lit_topology_merge_losses.md` names it the
    correct Phase-C topology pilot; the Betti-matching route is the fallback and a hard C++ dependency.
